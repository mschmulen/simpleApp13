### Misc Notes

The limit of 750 references does NOT apply to the parent/child references when using CKShare! But you can only share 5.000 CKRecords in total using a CKShare - otherwise, this undocumented limit will hit you

Maximum number of source references to a single target where the action is delete self = 750
